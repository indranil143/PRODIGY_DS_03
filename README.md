# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction
I built a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchases using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Key Steps
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned data and encoded categorical variables.
- Model Building: Developed a decision tree to predict purchases based on demographics and behavior.
- Evaluation: Measured performance with accuracy and other key metrics.

# Conclusion
The model effectively predicted purchase behavior, and visualizations highlighted the most important features influencing customer decisions.
